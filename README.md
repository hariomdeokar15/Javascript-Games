JavaScript Games Collection

Welcome to my JavaScript Games repository!
This repo is a collection of small, fun, and interactive games I’m building as part of my JavaScript learning journey. Each game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is stored in its own dedicated folder for clarity and organization.

Project Overview

The goal of this repository is to practice core web development skills while building real-world mini-projects.
Every game here focuses on improving one or more JavaScript concepts — from DOM manipulation and event handling to logic building and animation.
